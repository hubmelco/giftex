# Initial Set up And What You Need To Know

## After Cloning
### --- Setting up Server ---
- Go to `/Docs/Wiki/Setting Up and Running the Server` and follow those instructions for getting the server up and running

### --- Setting up front end ---
- Go to `/Docs/Wiki/Setting up the Client` and follow those instructions for getting the front-end running
###  -- Understanding It All ---
- Once you run both the server and the WebApp/react-app, the webpage should pop up.
- Inside of `/Docs/Wiki` you can look at both description files for front-end and back-end files (`BackEnd_Class_Descriptions` and `FrontEnd_Class_Descriptions`). The front-end file structure is based off of where the component shows up on the real webpage.

- For information on how to use stripe and more in-depth explanations on a lot of the stuff in the repo, check the GitLab wiki pages. 

#### --- Getting Started ---
- All of our plans we had for next steps and bugs that need to get fixed are also in the GitLab wiki. It should be named Next Steps. 
- If you have any questions our emails are in the repo wiki and the GitLab wiki pages, Good Luck!
